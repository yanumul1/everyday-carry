# Chandrashekhar's Everyday Carry Items

Here are the three things I never leave home without:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/airpods/">AirPods</a> – For entertainment and communication apps on the go</li>
  <li><a href="/wallet/">Wallet</a> – For holding ID, cash, and cards</li>
  <li><a href="/keys/">Keys</a> – Giving me access to my apartment and car</li>
</ul>

<p>Each item plays an important role in my daily routine and helps keep me connected, prepared, and organized.</p>
